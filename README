cl-figleaf is a minimalist code coverage utility for Common Lisp,
layered on top of the lisp-unit unit test framework. It's pretty basic
and only analyzes function coverage. It doesn't analyze coverage by
statement or condition / decision logic. Despite its limitations, it's
still quite useful and easy to use.
